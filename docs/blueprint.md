## Core Features:

- Signature Generation: Generate an HTML email signature based on user-provided information, ensuring it meets email client compatibility standards.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the email signature is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile) using HTML table structures without CSS media queries.
- HTML Optimization: Optimize the generated HTML to meet size constraints (under 15KB for HTML, under 50KB total) while using table-based layouts and inline styles.
- External Asset Management: Handle external image assets (logo, social icons) by ensuring they are hosted securely, optimized for Hi-DPI displays, and referenced correctly in the signature.
- Email Client Testing: Offer Litmus or similar testing to guarantee rendering consistency across major email clients, providing a preview of the signature in various environments.
- Mobile Optimization: Adjust the generated HTML for Mobile use

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, corporate blue (#1E3A8A) to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F9FAFB) for a clean, modern backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#34D399) for highlights and social media icons, providing a subtle pop without overwhelming the design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif (sans-serif) to give a modern, objective, neutral look; the font will be used in both headlines and the body of the signature.
- Use minimalist, flat icons for social media links, ensuring they are appropriately sized and high-resolution. They must be hosted externally via secure links.
- Employ a well-balanced, tabular layout with generous white space to avoid clutter and ensure readability across all devices. Information sections (name, title, contact details, address) should be logically grouped and visually distinct.
- Subtle hover effects on social media icons.
